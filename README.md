# Prelim Activity 01: Codac Logistics Delivery & Fuel Auditor

**Name:** Justine Berdejo  

## Task Description
This laboratory activity focuses on the development of a console-based C# system for Codac Logistics. The system is designed to track and evaluate a delivery driver’s fuel expenses and delivery performance for a single vehicle across a five-day work week.

The system gathers essential driver information, validates the total distance traveled to ensure accurate data entry, and records daily fuel expenses using a one-dimensional array. It processes the collected data to compute total and average fuel costs, assess fuel efficiency levels, and determine whether the driver remained within the assigned weekly fuel budget. The output is presented in a structured audit report intended to support performance evaluation and financial review.
